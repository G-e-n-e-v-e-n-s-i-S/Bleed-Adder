Select the folder containing the renders.

Define width and height of the bleed to add. This is in percentage.
4.8% horizontal bleed will add 18 pixels on either sides of a 375 pixels wide image.
3.6% vertical bleed will add 19 pixels on the top and bottom of a 523 pixels tall image.

Define which color the bleed should be.

Decide if the corners should be recolored.
If the image contains white corners (like MSE outputs), select yes.
If the corners are already filled in with a border or art, select no.

Hit the "Add Bleed Margins" button.
