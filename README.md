# Instructions

Download the .jar file from the Releases page and run it by double-clicking on it.

(You must have the Java Runtime Environment installed: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

Select the folder containing the card images.

Define the width and height of the bleed to add. This is in percentage.
4.8% horizontal bleed will add 18 pixels on either sides of a 375 pixels wide image (150 DPI).
3.6% vertical bleed will add 19 pixels on the top and bottom of a 523 pixels tall image (150 DPI).
These values should work well for any size, but you might want to increase them a bit.

Define which color the bleed should be.

Decide if the corners should be recolored.
If the images contain white corners (like Magic Set Editor outputs), select yes.
If the corners are already filled in with a border or art, select no.

Hit the "Add Bleed Margins" button.
